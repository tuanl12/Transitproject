# Bayesian Forecast for Transit Demand - Project

This is the place to store the codes for performing exploratory data analysis tasks on APC and Ventra dataset (file "APC_EDA.R" and "Ventra_EDA.R", respectively). I perform the MCMC simulation on Amazon Web Server using the modeling file in Stan ("stamodeling.stan" for Normal prior and "poissnorm.stan" file for Poisson prior) and the execution file is in R ("sampling.R").
